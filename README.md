# Discord Mods Bot

## Getting started

Run the bot using `cargo run --release`. You will need to provide several environment variables:
- DISCORD_TOKEN: the Discord bot token acquired via the Discord Developer Portal
- MOD_ROLE_ID: the ID of the Moderator role on your Discord server

An example command-line for Linux would be: `MOD_ROLE_ID=788427199761481799 DISCORD_TOKEN=REDACTED cargo run --release`
